For Christmas this year, I got a set of Dykem paint markers from a friend during a secret santa exchange and a Sony a5100 mirrorless camera from the folks. Guess it's time to get into graffiti and street photography. I can be a cheap knockoff Banksy. Somehow, I don't think Banksy uses Dykem brand markers. I have to admit the ability to write on virtually anything is fairly intoxicating... or maybe that's just the marker fumes. Probably a more in depth post about the Sony once I get a chance to test it out.
