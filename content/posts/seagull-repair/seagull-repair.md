As of late, it seems a lot of my time is spent fixing film cameras. Could have something to do with my role as TA for a film photography class at MIT (EC.305) or my sudden excess spending on admittedly crappy vintage film equipment. But I swear it was such a good deal on eBay!

Anyways, the camera I'm attempting to coax back to life today is a Seagull TLR medium format camera. The camera belongs to the class I'm TAing for and is used primarily for show-and-tell considering the majority of students will only shoot 35mm and the camera doesn't work.

As far as prognoses go, this one could be a lot worse. The camera seems to be mostly functional with the exception of the shutter mechanism, which doesn't seem to want to trigger. Finally, after weeks of anticipation, I had enough time to sit down on a Saturday and take apart the camera. Before we do that though let me just add a little more about this particular Seagull and medium format TLR cameras.

The [Seagull Camera Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagull_Camera) came onto the photography scene in 1958. They produced a variety of cameras including SLR, TLR, and foldable, however, they're probably best known for their Rolleicord knockoff TLRs. They also happen to be the oldest camera manufacturer in China. The particular model of TLR that I am working on is the Seagull 4B. Interestingly, Seagull actually produced a different branding plate for domestic and international versions of this camera. The one I have (photo below) has Seagull written across the top whereas a person buying this camera back in mainland China would have gotten one with Seagull written in Chinese. Now I'm not going to lie. My Chinese reading ability is barely adequate to pass the second grade, but the top plate in Chinese is so much cooler than English version.

The Seagull 4B takes medium format film and produces negatives of either 6x6 or 645 if you have the right mask. If you are confused about film sizes and formats, I recommend this excellent post on the matter by Ken Rockwell on his [website](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/format.htm). The camera requires no batteries to operate which is a plus and is entirely manual exposure and focus. This means you need an external light meter or a really good eye to get the proper exposure on your shots.
Two For the Price of One
==========
This camera is also notable for being a twin lens reflex. This just means that the camera has two lens: one from which you view the subject your are photographing, and another for taking the actual photo. Of course this differs from the more common single lens reflex or SLR cameras, which use only a single lens for viewing and taking. If you are inexperienced with photography you might be wondering what all the fuss is about. Why make the distinction between viewing and taking? My phone only has one lens after all. The reason people go through the trouble of making SLR or TLR cameras instead of just your regular smart phone or point-and-shoot camera is to maintain the fidelity between the image you see through the view finder and the one the camera will take. This is important mostly so the photography can accurately gauge what the final negative will look like before applying adjustments. The closer the image is to the one you're trying to take means less tweaking in the darkroom or Photoshop after the fact.
Camera Autopsy
==========
Finally, we get to crack open the camera. After carefully peeling off the leather for reattachment in the future and removing a couple of small Phillips screws, the whole front plate of the camera can be removed. It's probably useful to note that screwing around with the f-stop and shutter speed dials after this is not the best idea as reattaching the cover requires them to be lined up. Since we're screwing around with the camera we're going to do it anyways. Lining up the dials again is possible, but just a pain.
