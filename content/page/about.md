# A Little Bit About This Blog
This blog started as a way for me to document all the random shenanigans I tend to get up to. I have always been a fan of the blog as a format of documentation, being an avid fan of various other blogs ranging from the absurd to the incredibly useful and classic.

The title is a double entendre that can be taken to mean either the drill bits and metal chips found in the world of mechanical engineering or the ones and zeroes and integrated circuit chips found in the world of electrical engineering and computer science. As an individual with an interest in many different fields of engineering, this title seems apt.

On occasion, this blog will also feature other interests of mine including photography, vinyl, and film although they usually tie in some way to the stuff I make.
