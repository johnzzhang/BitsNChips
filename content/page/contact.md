John Zhang has been a Bostonian for ten years. He's not quite sure what to do with the next ten.

He is best reached via Carrier Pidgeon, although he prefers email. He enjoys San Pellegrino, bizarre movies, and writing about himself in the third person present active indicative. His hobbies include playing guitar, collecting records, and photography.

He is currently an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying to become some kind of engineer (or so he's been told). He hopes to prolong this process indeterminably.

Despite his brief and solipsistic existence as a human person, he has acquired a couple of useful skills, including but not limited to:

* the ability to write code,
* the capacity to understand more than two forms of human speech,
* the ability to manufacture useful shapes out of stock metals and materials,
* and his "amazing" ability to read and follow simple instructions.
