Architectural-scale robotic arm manipulator.

My Sophomore fall I worked with the Mediated Matters group at the MIT Media on the Digital Construction Platform robot. Although the DCP is a fairly complicated system, the portion of the robot I worked on is the J1 joint. The primary result of the UROP was designing and fabricating a mount for an absolute encoder for measuring the position of the J1 revolute joint. This sensor reading was then combined with the measurement from the built-in relative encoder to give a more accurate reading of the J1 joint to combat the large amount of backlash in the gear train.
