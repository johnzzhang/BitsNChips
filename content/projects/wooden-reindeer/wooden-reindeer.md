Wooden reindeer carved on a scroll saw. Story in six images.
<!--more-->

Inspired by all the woodworking channels on YouTube making wooden reindeer, I decided to give it a go. At the time, I had also been taking EC.310, a creative imaging class that required a six image story as one of its assignments, so I decided to kill two birds with one stone. So here's a story about the making of a reindeer, or maybe it's about the reindeer, I don't know. I suppose it's up for interpretation. The whole endeavor took about one afternoon after carefully setting up my camera on a tripod and marking the template onto the wood. The project was done in its entirety on the Hobby Shop scroll saw. Thanks a bunch to Colby and Hayami.
