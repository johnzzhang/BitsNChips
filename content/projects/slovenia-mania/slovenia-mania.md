My first three pound fighting robot. Horizontal bar spinner. Excellent fight video.
<!--more-->

My introduction to the world of small fighting robots. Co-built with Andrew, another MIT freshman at the time, with excellent mentorship from Fred, MechE Class of 13', Slovenia Mania proved to be an excellent horizontal spinner. The name came from the original 3D printed chassis that accidently featured the same colors as the Slovenian flag since the Dimension kept running out of filament.

The version of the robot in the video below has a different chassis design where the top and bottom plate are made of water jet aluminum and held together by aluminum standoffs. This robot was the predecessor of Best Korea, one of Fred's current robots.

Suspiciously, many of my photos from the build seem to have disappeared. Here is a video of it in action anyways. Spoilers-I lose this fight because I'm a bad driver-but not bad for a first attempt if I may say so and the fight is definitely worth a watch. Promise of sparks and flying robots await.
