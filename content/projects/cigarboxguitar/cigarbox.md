World's first and only (as far as I know) carbon fiber cigar box guitar.
<!--more-->

I've been a fan of eccentric instruments since I first caught wind of the Leonard Solomon, creator of the magnificent bellowphone. After seeing Jack White build a coke can plank guitar in the documentary "This Might Get Loud", I found myself itching to build my own cigar box guitar. The cigar box was bought for a dollar from "Leavitt and Pierce" in Harvard Square, and the carbon fiber was a generous donation from my friend Fred, after he destroyed the front of my cigar box. This instrument was built and finished in a single night at MITERS during my freshman year. I used only parts from Ace's hardware since I didn't have a car at the time and Home Depot is far away and I didn't know about Rocklers Woodworking in Somerville.
